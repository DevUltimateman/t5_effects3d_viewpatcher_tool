# t5_effects3d_viewpatcher_tool

Fx file patcher for T5 Effects3d Viewer. Populates Effects3d's dropdown list based on the files you have dropped to this executable. These fxs can then be viewed from Effects3d app's dropdown list. Work in progress and the patcher is mainly made for personal use of mine. Feel free to use the tool if you find it useful, but don't expect feature requests for this software.
